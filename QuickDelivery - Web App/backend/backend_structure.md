# Quick Delivery Backend Directory Structure

This document explains the purpose of all essential directories and files in the complete backend structure of the Quick Delivery application, which is built on the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) PHP framework.

## Key Directories

*   **`app/`**: This is where the core logic of the application resides. Almost all the classes you write will be in this directory. It primarily contains:
    *   **`Http/Controllers/`**: Contains the controllers that receive incoming requests, process business logic, and return responses (either JSON for APIs or views).
    *   **`Models/`**: Contains Eloquent ORM models. These represent your database tables and handle interactions with the database.

*   **`bootstrap/`**: Contains the `app.php` file which bootstraps the framework. This directory also houses a `cache` directory which contains framework generated files for performance optimization such as route and services cache files.

*   **`config/`**: As the name implies, this directory contains all of your application's configuration files. Settings for database connections, caching, mail, and other services are defined here.

*   **`database/`**: This directory contains database migrations, model factories, and seeders.
    *   **`migrations/`**: Version control for your database schema. Instead of manually creating tables, you define them here.
    *   **`seeders/`**: Used to populate the database with initial or dummy data.
    *   **`factories/`**: Used to generate large amounts of dummy data, typically for testing.

*   **`public/`**: This is the document root for your application. The `index.php` file in this directory serves as the entry point for all requests entering your application and configures autoloading. This directory also houses your assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS.

*   **`resources/`**: Contains your views as well as your raw, uncompiled assets such as CSS or JavaScript.
    *   **`views/`**: This directory is essential as it houses all of your HTML templates (Blade files), including your Admin Dashboard views (`admin/dashboard.blade.php`).

*   **`routes/`**: Contains all of the route definitions for your application.
    *   **`web.php`**: Routes for the web interface (views, admin panel), usually assigned the `web` middleware group containing session state and CSRF protection.
    *   **`api.php`**: Routes for your API. These are typically stateless and are authenticated via tokens, returning JSON responses to your frontend.

*   **`storage/`**: Contains your compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework.
    *   **`app/`**: Can be used to store any files generated by your application (e.g., user-uploaded files).
    *   **`framework/`**: Used to store framework generated files and caches.
    *   **`logs/`**: Contains your application's log files. Essential for debugging errors.

*   **`tests/`**: Contains your automated tests (both Feature tests and Unit tests).

*   **`vendor/`**: Contains your Composer dependencies. This is where the Laravel framework itself and any third-party PHP packages are installed. You should never edit files in this directory.

## Essential Root Files

*   **`.env`**: The environment configuration file. It contains secret credentials (like database passwords, API keys) and environment-specific settings (like `APP_ENV=local`). **This file should never be committed to version control.**
*   **`.env.example`**: A template file for `.env`. This *is* committed to version control so other developers know which environment variables are required.
*   **`artisan`**: The command-line interface included with Laravel. It provides helpful commands to build files, run migrations, clear caches, and start the development server (`php artisan serve`).
*   **`composer.json`** & **`composer.lock`**: Define the PHP dependencies for your project. `composer.json` is where you request packages, and `composer.lock` locks them to specific versions to ensure consistency across environments.
*   **`package.json`** & **`package-lock.json`**: Define the Node.js/NPM dependencies, typically used for frontend assets like compiling CSS/JS via Vite or Mix.
*   **`vite.config.js`**: Configuration file for Vite, the modern frontend build tool used to bundle your application's CSS and JavaScript assets.
